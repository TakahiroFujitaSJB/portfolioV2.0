# Hello! and welcome to my Sample Online Store created from React.js and Sass!

This is a sample frontend project using React.js as well as Sass css. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## It's online using Firebase! Access it now!

This website is deployed online using Firebase: ----

## How launch locally

In case you wish to run locally, in the project directory, you can run:

### 'npm install'

This should download all packages and depndancies but if not, here are some other commands:
 * npm i react
 * npm i react-router-dom  
 * npm i  -D sass    
  

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.



# Currently there are list of things to keep in mind with this app:
 * data.js in src/lib is a sample json simulation.
 * Currently only the first two items has their own page for the sake of time.
 * The buy option is missing temporary while I test out shopping cart feature using Redux
